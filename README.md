# SeaLions-Data-Visualization
Data Visualization in D3

This project visualizes the number of sea lions and sea level changes as a circle.
The notation here is that when sea level increases, the number of sea lions are reducing.
So if you change the value for sea level from the slider then both the circles will be transitioned to sea level change and its respective number of sea lions.

To run the application, simply run the `index.html` on any web browser.
